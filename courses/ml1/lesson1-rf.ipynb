    "I'll be using a *top-down* teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate.  Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n",

Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.\n",

    "It's important to note what metric is being used for a project. Generally, selecting the metric(s) is an important part of the project setup. However, in this case Kaggle tells us what metric to use: RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices. Therefore we take the log of the prices, so that RMSE will give us what we need."
